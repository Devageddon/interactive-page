  <!-- INTRODUCTION -->
  <section class="text-section">
    <div class="content">
      <h1>Introduction</h1>
   <p>New Brunswick boasts a rich history of manufacturing, including everything from chocolates to fish, French fries, lumber and oil products. This variety of industry, and the province’s diverse population, multiplicity of residential types, and excellence in technological innovation make it fertile ground for research and development. </p>
   <p>The beautiful city of Saint John solidifies this status, connecting the region to international trade routes through Port Saint John on sea, within 25km of a variety of land assets, as well as a 1.5h distance to the Greater Moncton Roméo LeBlanc International Airport (YQM), an international air cargo facility.</p>
   <p>Adding to the richness of the province and city, the University of New Brunswick is Canada’s oldest English language university. UNB has an enduring reputation of excellence in education and research, and a proven track record of collaboration with impact.  Its Saint John campus, with locations in both the city centre and Port Saint John, has a reputation for its industry connections; for staying up to date with contemporary issues, to predict solutions, and to lead in applied education and research</p>
   <span class="box">

    <li>Leverage the educational brand of UNB and the industry brand of DP World will carry market value.</li>
  </ul>
  
  </div>
</div>
  </div>
</div>
<p>We will work with DP World to identify existing programming opportunities. We will work together in a collaborative space to develop new, customized programs. </p>
<p>UNB has a history of creating customized programs to meet the needs of business.  For example, on the academic side, the UNB Saint John MBA developed a customized MBA program for Irving Oil that combined academic training with experiential learning opportunities within the company.  Over 150 Irving Oil Employees went through this program. Mike Aashar, the General Manager at the time spoke to the success of the program in two ways.  First having one of the most highly trained workforces in the industry based on parentage of employees and second, having covered the tuition costs in monies saved in consultant fees by having employees work with managers on company issues as the experiential component of their degree program.  </p>
<span class="box">
  <p>Opportunities exist for those entering our credit certificate, diploma and degree programs to apply for Prior Learning Assessment. This means that their work experience and other skills can give them advanced standing in an academic program of their choosing, which reduces the number of courses they need to take in their chosen program.  </p>
</span>
<p>To respond to the changing needs of learners, and to reach geographically dispersed populations, UNB offers over 100 online credit courses and has expanded into fully-online programs. </p>
<p>Our online courses vary in delivery style. </p>

<p><img src="/page/img/chart_01.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>In addition to academic programming UNB also offers both executive education and professional development programming and has received recognition for many of its program initiatives.</p>
<p>
  For example: UNB offers a non-credit Occupational Health and Safety Certificate that meets the formal education requirements for certification as a Canadian Registered Safety Technician.  If completed along with our Diploma in Occupational Health and Safety, learners will have fulfilled the educational hours to write Canadian Registered Safety Professional (CRSP) exam. UNB’s non-credit certificate in Safety Leadership counts toward continuous learning points for those with designations and an Ethics for Safety Leaders Program that meets the requirements for BCRSP’s mandatory ethics course for BCRSP.
  </p>
  <span class="box">
    <p>UNB is committed to education that transcends boundaries and borders. No matter where our learners find themselves, we are dedicated to their transformational growth. </p>

      <p>UNB understands the value of a collaborative approach for problem solving and big sky thinking. With maximizing impact as the core deliverable, having the right minds around the table takes on even more significance. </p>
      <p>The Global Supply Chain Collaboration Hub will use several local locations (Port Saint John Fundy Room, UNB MBA Building uptown Saint John, UNB campuses in Saint John, Fredericton, and Moncton) as determined by the resources required, problem being solved, or partners participating. Capitalizing on UNB’s diverse real-estate assets around the province, as well as UNB’s new dedicated presence on Port Saint John property, will present the immediate opportunity to create a different kind of innovation mind space, focused on creating collaborative teams to tackle challenges, identify opportunities and work together to define a path forward with growth and impact as the goals.  </p>
      <p>Our collaborative approach to accessing expertise, information and thought leadership as opposed to formal consulting services, fostering unfettered communication channels impervious to physical location is what sets us apart in the education space. This environment allows for the intersection of knowledge, skills, experience, interest and passion with opportunity, challenge, need, and unanticipated events allowing us to question what is, what could be and what should be as we explore innovative solutions that will shape the future.</p>
      <span class="box">
        <p>UNB will act as the aggregator that brings together the right people, ideas and skills to address the issues of the moment, and to help DP World predict the solutions needed for the future.</p>
